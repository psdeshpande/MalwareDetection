MalwareDetection
================

Implemented malware detection technique using functional call graph analysis using JAVA. 

-In this project, I implemented metamorphic malware detection technique using
functional call graph. Firstly, executable malware sample is disassembled using
popular disassembler IDA Pro. Secondly, function call graph is created from dis-
assembled program. Then, various methods including caller-callee relation between
functions, operational code information and graph coloring techniques are combined
to measure similarity between variant of known malware sample.

I used different data structure in this project like Graph, HashMap, Linked List, Queue. 
Also I used algorithm like breadth firt search graph traversal(DFS) etc. This helped me to 
improve my skills in data structures and algorithms.

To run the program : 

-javac malwareDetection.java
-java malwareDetection
