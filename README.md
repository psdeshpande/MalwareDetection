MalwareDetection
================

Implemented malware detection technique using functional call graph analysis using JAVA. 

-In this project, I implemented metamorphic malware detection technique using
functional call graph. Firstly, executable malware sample is disassembled using
popular disassembler IDA Pro. Secondly, function call graph is created from dis-
assembled program. Then, various methods including caller-callee relation between
functions, operational code information and graph coloring techniques are combined
to measure similarity between variant of known malware sample.

To run the program :
